To run a program using the Z shell (zsh) with the script named `sub.sh`, you would use the following command in the terminal:

```
zsh ./sub.sh
```

The code here utilizes an additional process dedicated to file writing. Consequently, for a domain decomposition size of 2x2x2, parallel execution requires 9 processes.
